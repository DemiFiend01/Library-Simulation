# Library-Simulation
Library system simulation in c++ in the terminal.
This project was created for my computer programming laboratories.
It is object-oriented and contains the usage of txt files.
There are two modes: the admin mode and the user mode.
The admin is able to add a new user or a new book, whereas the user can borrow or return a book.
